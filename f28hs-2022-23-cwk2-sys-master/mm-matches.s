@ This ARM Assembler code should implement a matching function, for use in the MasterMind program, as
@ described in the CW2 specification. It should produce as output 2 numbers, the first for the
@ exact matches (peg of right colour and in right position) and approximate matches (peg of right
@ color but not in right position). Make sure to count each peg just once!
	
@ Example (first sequence is secret, second sequence is guess):
@ 1 2 1
@ 3 1 3 ==> 0 1
@ You can return the result as a pointer to two numbers, or two values
@ encoded within one number
@

.text
@ this is the matching fct that should be called from the C part of the CW	
.global         matches
@ use the name `main` here, for standalone testing of the assembler code
@ when integrating this code into `master-mind.c`, choose a different name
@ otw there will be a clash with the main function in the C code
.global         main
main: 
	LDR  R2, =secret	@ pointer to secret sequence
	LDR  R3, =guess		@ pointer to guess sequence

	@ you probably need to initialise more values here

	@ ... COMPLETE THE CODE BY ADDING YOUR CODE HERE, you should use sub-routines to structure your code

exit:	@MOV	 R0, R4		@ load result to output register
	MOV 	 R7, #1		@ load system call code
	SWI 	 0		@ return this value

@ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ sub-routines

@ this is the matching fct that should be callable from C	
matches:			@ Input: R0, R1 ... ptr to int arrays to match ; Output: R0 ... exact matches (10s) and approx matches (1s) of base COLORS
	@ COMPLETE THE CODE HERE

@ show the sequence in R0, use a call to printf in libc to do the printing, a useful function when debugging 
showseq: 			@ Input: R0 = pointer to a sequence of 3 int values to show
	@ COMPLETE THE CODE HERE (OPTIONAL)
